    computer: `This is where all the research and coding gets done. 
    Here is my <a href="https://github.com/MystxcHD" target="_blank">Github</a>!`,

    books: `I love to read up on the latest tech news, especially the new and exciting
    field of AI and ML!`,

    bed: `I'm a night owl and produce my best projects at night, but sleep is one of my
    top priorties.`,

    projects: `I'm an avid learner of the latest technologies, so I've doing a lot of experimentation
    regarding AI/ML. I'm a hackathon fanatic and have completed projects regarding data analysis, machine learning, 
    database management, and so much more! I'm certified in Python development for data science by IBM 
    (<a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/8336d5f1aa1648c0b8b98f2d06fa9a55" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>)
    and have extensive programming experience in Javascript, Java, HTML, and CSS. You can find full details on my LinkedIn 
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/siva-sricharan-dasaka/" target="_blank">here</a>.`,

    introFact: `Hey wanna play a game? There are 3 campfires scattered across the map,
    each containing details on some of the projects I've built. Up for the challenge?`,

    fact1: `When I first learned to code in the summer following my freshman year of high school, I built a Discord bot
    called Tabby which had a bunch of fun minigames like 8-ball, insults, and a dice simulator. Tabby came with
    a fully functioning economy as well. During winter break of the same year, I created Coinfinder, another Discord bot, but
    this one used API calls to fetch market data on cryptocurrencies and all the analytics regarding each coin. These projects were
    essential as they taught me a ton about programming, algorithms, and how to efficiently read documentation.`,

    fact2: `I've built a machine learning model that takes in the molecular descriptor of a compound
    and predicts the solubility. This was a lot of fun to make and I learned a lot about various techniques 
    such as tree regressors and model validation.`,

    fact3: `During a 24 hours high school hackathon, our team built a website that centered around patients
    who aren't able to seek medical attention but need it urgently. Our app connects patients to doctors online and 
    uses artificial intelligence to give medical recommendations based off the patient's symptoms. We ended up winning the
    hackathon and I got a brand new monitor :D`,
