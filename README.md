# Portfolio Game
Hey! My name is Siva and I'm an aspiring software engineer! My passions lie in solving problems, doing research, and building new, cool products. Prior to this project, I hadn't explored the field of graphics and game development, but hopefully, I can learn
how to make games and grow as a software engineer. This project is meant for those who want to know a bit more about my professional background in a fun, relaxing way.
